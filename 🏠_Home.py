    # Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

    The **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)** is a refundable tax credit available to eligible taxpayers
    in the United States. It is designed to help low-to-moderate income working individuals and families
    by reducing their tax burden and potentially providing a refund. In many cases, the EITC can
    significantly boost the income of those who qualify, making it an important tool in the fight
    against poverty.
